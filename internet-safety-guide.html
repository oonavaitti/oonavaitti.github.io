    <h2>1. Preface</h2>
    <p> This guide is aimed for non-technical 
        people who would like some basic guidance and concrete steps to take on internet safety and privacy, 
        written from the personal experiences of one privacy-conscious netizen. 
        I'm not associated with Mozilla in any capacity,
         I just happen to use Firefox so that's what I can write about the easiest.
        DYOR (Do Your Own Research)! Written in November 2024.</p>

    <p>Some relevant terms, in the context of online activity:</p>
    <p>
        <b>Security</b> means that you're resilient towards exploitation, aka hacking, malware, phishing, etc.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Privacy</b> means that you have the right to decide what parts of your digital life are shared; when, how and with whom. 
        Your data is yours and you should be making informed choices about sharing it. </p>

        <p>
        <b>Anonymity</b> means that what you do online can't be traced back to you. 
        Your real identity can't be identified or reached through your online actions.

    </p>

        <p>Everyone has different needs and 
        lines on what they deem worth it, regarding their security, privacy and anonymity. 
        You have to weigh the importance of all the different aspects regarding your own situation.
        The only way to be completely secure online is to not be online, so what we're doing is our best!
            </p>

    <h2>2. Browsers</h2>
        <p>I like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>: it works well for me, 
        it has good built-in privacy and security protections, and it’s
        open source (meaning the source code is freely available). It’s
        also not based on Chromium, Google’s browser project, which 
        has pretty much a monopoly on the browser market. I personally like to support 
        the continuous existence of any alternatives! An even more privacy-focused version of Firefox is <a href="https://librewolf.net/">LibreWolf</a>.</p>
        

        <p>Ever wondered what information websites can get out of your browser? You can test your browser's digital fingerprint
            on <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">coveryourtracks.eff.org</a>!
        </p>

        <h4>Extensions:</h4>

        <p>If you’re using Firefox (or Chrome), a good extension to have is <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>. It blocks ads, trackers, malware sites 
            and more. You can also easily 
            turn it off for specific sites and configure it to your liking.</p>

        <p>Not about privacy, but I also like to use some site-specific
            extensions to make them more customizable:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://untrap.app/">Untrap for Youtube</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://addons.tumblr.com/">XKit Rewritten for Tumblr</a></li>

    <h2>3. Passwords</h2>
        <p><b>A password manager</b> considerably eases your life once you manage 
            to set one up properly. No need to remember passwords yourself, which also 
            eradicates the inclination to reuse passwords or make them easy to
             remember (and thus easy to hack). </p>
             
             <p> You most likely have already used a password manager in some form, 
             maybe a built-in browser manager (like on Firefox), or one on your phone. 
             Ever seen a pop-up saying something like “Remember this password?” when 
             logging in somewhere? That’s what that is.</p>
             
            <p>It’s completely fine to use these (if you trust the companies), 
             but make it <i>intentional</i>: understand where your passwords are collected, so 
             you can find them when you need to and keep them up-to-date. Take note of the password manager’s other 
             functionalities too, like:
            <ul>
                <li>Autogenerated unique passwords (when updating or making a new account)</li>
                <li>Website breach alerts</li>
            </ul></p>

            <p>If you want a dedicated password manager app for cross-device functionality,
                 extra features, or whatever, there's a lot of options out there. Make sure the service provider is one you can trust. You can consider things like: where is my passwords saved, and how are they encrypted? Has the company been in major controversies or data breaches?
            </p>

            <div class="how-to">
                <h4>HOW-TO</h4>
                   <b> Find the Firefox password manager:</b>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open the application menu (top-right corner <b>≡</b>)</li>
                            <li>Click "Passwords"</li>
                        </ol>
            </div>

            <p>
            <b>You should also consider signing up for <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a></b>. 
            There you can check if your credentials have been part of any data breaches, and it'll inform you if your info comes up in any newly discovered ones.
            </p>

            <h4>Multi-Factor Authentication</h4>
            <p>MFA means that you need to confirm your logins through an additional measure, 
                like an authenticator app (recommended) or SMS. In a situation where someone gets your password, they can't use it to simply log in.</p>
            <p>It is recommended to turn on MFA (or 2FA, 2-factor authentication) for 
                at least accounts with any sensitive information, and important 
                social media accounts wherever possible. It can be a hassle at the 
                start and when you have to use devices where you can’t stay logged in, 
                but it’s worth it. Every platform has their own MFA settings, check them out
                at your own consideration.</p>
            </div>

        <h2>4. On VPNs</h2>
        <p>You generally shouldn't need a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for normal web browsing at home. If you're considering using one,
            understand what they're for and what their limitations are. VPNs differ from each other too (DYOR!)
        </p>
        <p><b>What VPNs <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CAN'T</span> do:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make you anonymous and hide your online activity</li>
                    <li>Protect you from cyber threats generally</li>
                </ul></p>

        <p><b>What VPNs <i>can</i> do:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help you access geo-blocked content by making it seem like you're in a different country</li>
            <li>Hide the sites you visit from your internet service provider (but not from the VPN company!)</li>
            <li>Help encrypt your traffic when connected to untrusted public wi-fi</li>
        </ul></p>
        
            <p>If you're looking for real anonymity, you can read about <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>.</p>

<div id="practices" class="box" style="background-color: rgb(255, 241, 232); border-color: rgb(240, 168, 14);">
    <h2>5. Good Practices</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Know your rights.</b> EU citizens, read about <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/rights-individuals-under-general-data-protection-regulation">GDPR</a>. For everyone, you can check out this map for data protection laws worldwide on <a href="https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide">unctad.org</a>.</li>
        <li><b>Actually read terms of services and privacy policies.</b> Yeah, they're a slog, but it's good to know what you're agreeing to, and how platforms use your data.</li>
        <li><b>Keep your devices up to date.</b> I know that sometimes new updates suck for user experience, but that's also how the developers patch security problems.</li>
        <li><b>Back up your data.</b> If there's files, photos, anything at all you want to keep safe, you should have them backed up in at least couple of places (cloud, hard drives, whatever fits you).</li>
    </ul>
